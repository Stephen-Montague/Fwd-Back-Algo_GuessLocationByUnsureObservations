# Fwd-Back-Algo_GuessLocationByUnsureObservations

Simulates a moving AI agent at an unknown location in a grid that must guess location based on a series of unsure observations.

In general, the longer the AI observes (with an expected accuracy merely over 50%), the more highly confident its guess. 

For every step, every location in the grid receives a probability, so multiple informed guesses can be made.
